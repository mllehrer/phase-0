<p> Version control is a way programmers can track changes in a program. Programs are often complex pieces of code with a lot of moving parts. It's easy to make mistakes and not always easy to find them. By using version control, programmers can get a better sense of where they went wrong when there is a bug, and they can also preserve a working, bug-free model to go back to. Git is a form of version-control software. By using commits, it allows "save points" in the code that you can fall back to if you make a mistake. It also allows branches, which can be worked on without affecting the main code, and then merged with the main ("master") branch of code when they are complete. </p>

<p>
GitHub is an online platform for git version control. Storing code on GitHub's servers backs it up and allows it to be edited by multiple people, who can make their own branches and then request to have them added back to the main code. By hosting code on servers, instead of on individual computers, the creation and editing process is made more collaborative.

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Semantic tags like <header> and <footer> are great and should be used for pretty much every page. I like <main> and <section> as well. The best tags should be easy to understand and define necessary elements for a page.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser "reads" html and displays it from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Sublime is full of good shortcuts! I learned how to effectively use the tab key and create snippets for use in the tab key. I will be researching more sublime shortcuts because they save time and also reduce error.
